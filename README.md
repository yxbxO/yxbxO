# The Foundation
My journey began with **simple scripting and automation**, exploring **Python, Bash, and PowerShell** to solve everyday problems and understand the fundamentals of programming logic. These early experiments taught me to think systematically about problems while building a solid foundation in control flow, data structures, and the core principles that would guide my deeper exploration into systems programming.

# Deep System Mastery & Game Engine Research
Driven by curiosity about how systems really work, I dove headfirst into **low-level programming and security research**. I mastered **C, C++, and Assembly** while developing expertise in **reverse engineering, anticheat/antivirus evasion, and EDR analysis**. This work involved creating **kernel-mode and user-mode processes** for security applications and implementing protection mechanisms.

Through **game engine analysis and educational reverse engineering**, I learned **3D mathematics, collision detection, and coordinate transformations**. Creating educational trainers taught me **trigonometry, matrix operations, and spatial relationships** between local 3D world positions and 2D screen projections—knowledge that proves valuable in graphics programming and performance optimization.

# Modern Application Development
While my passion lies in systems programming, I've also developed practical skills in **modern web technologies**. I have intermediate knowledge of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, with some experience in **TypeScript and React** for building responsive applications. This frontend experience, though not my primary focus, allows me to create complete solutions and understand the full stack from kernel drivers to user interfaces.

# Today's Focus & Continuous Growth
I specialize in **security-focused systems programming**, from **Windows driver development** to **application protection and security research**. Currently, I'm **mastering modern C++** — my go-to language — exploring advanced features and optimization techniques.

My **game engine analysis hobby** continues as a source of learning, keeping me sharp on **advanced mathematics and real-time optimization**. I see myself as a **software engineer with a passion for reverse engineering** — building secure systems by understanding how they can be analyzed and fortified.
